      <h2>B. The Evolution of Latin</h2>
      <p>Languages evolve constantly. Some evolve faster than others. A language may undergo rapid
      changes over a period before settling into relative stasis.</p>
      <p>In more recent times, globalization and
      the spread of English as the language of commerce have sped up the process dramatically.
      Consider the differences between the English of Geoffrey Chaucer’s time (14th century C.E.),
      William Shakespeare’s (16th and 17th), Jane Austen’s (19th), and P. Diddy’s (21st). Englishspeakers might be able to read Chaucer’s English with the help of footnotes; would Chaucer
      comprehend hip-hop English, whether by listening or reading the lyric sheet?</p>
      <p>Before Chaucer, the Germanic tongue known as English had already been absorbing elements of
      Romantic and Celtic languages for nearly a millennium, growing and changing along the way.
      Even from a late Medieval perspective, the Old English in the epic poem Beowulf would be
      barely recognizable as English. (I would <em>love</em> to see someone try to rap in Anglo-Saxon.)</p>
      <p>Classical Latin also evolved. In its infancy, it was a regional variant of Proto-Italic, which itself
      was a regional variant of Indo-European. It took on vocabulary and syntax from neighboring
      languages such as Oscan and Umbrian, from the tongue of the colonizing Etruscans, and from
      the Greeks and Carthaginians whose lands the Romans conquered. Educated Romans learned to
      read and speak Attic Greek (the dialect spoken around Athens), usually from enslaved Greeks
      who worked as tutors; Roman society appropriated directly from Greek hundreds of words that
      Latin lacked (e.g., <strong>philosophia</strong>), transcribing them into the Roman alphabet.</p>
      <h3>Variations across Space and Time</h3>
      <p>Within Classical Latin itself there were variations, just as we find in English: The vernacular of
      the streets and markets, depicted in the comic plays of Titus Maccius <u>Plautus</u> in the 3rd century
      B.C.E., differs radically from the refined oratory of Marcus Tullius <u>Cicerō</u> or the carefully
      constructed poetry of Publius <u>Vergil</u>ius Mārō. Tribes in the far-flung colonies likely lent their
      own flavors to Latin, just as the spoken English of the Americas, India, and Anglophone African
      nations differs from that of the home country. Literary Latin contains many examples of archaic
      spellings and inflections, inspired by writings from centuries earlier that scholars transcribed and
      kept alive.</p>
      <p>Despite centuries of change, language authorities kept the “official” Latin language from
      evolving beyond their control. The rules of written Latin remained much the same until the fall
      of the Empire and beyond.</p>
      <p>After the Roman Empire went out of business, regional “vulgar” variants of Latin evolved into
      the Romantic family of languages. (The word <em>vulgar</em> comes from the Latin word <strong>vulgus</strong>,
      meaning <em>the common people</em>; its origins have nothing to do with lacking good manners.) This
      process of vulgarization began before the official collapse of the Empire in 476 C.E., because people in the colonies felt less
      compelled to converse in formal Latin than their cousins back in Rome. Today, the five most
      widely spoken vulgar Romance languages are French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and
      Spanish; also in that family are Catalan, Galician, Brazilian Portuguese, and the various regional
      languages of Italy.</p>
      <p>Latin survived beyond 476 mainly as the common language of the dominant institution of
      Medieval Europe, the Roman Church. Clerics and ecclesiastical scholars from Scandinavia to
      Ethiopia could converse and correspond in the language of the old Empire.</p>
      <p>In the millennium following the collapse of the Empire, Latin itself continued to evolve,
      although much more slowly than its descendant languages. Spellings, pronunciations, and rules
      of syntax underwent some subtle alterations over the centuries, culminating in the “Church
      Latin” familiar to anyone who has sung or officiated a Latin Mass.</p>
      <p>If Julius Caesar had an opportunity to travel through time and visit Renaissance Europe, he
      would have been able to converse with the clerics and Church officials. He might have to adjust
      to the Italian-style pronunciation of vowels and certain consonants, similar to the adjustments
      Shakespeare would need to make if he were to visit 21st-century England.</p>
