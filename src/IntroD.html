      <h2>D. Important Facts about Latin</h2>
      <p>At the general level, there are some important facts about Latin that one should know before attempting to learn it: in particular, that it has no definite or indefinite articles, that it is heavily inflected, and that inflections of words are more important than the order in which they appear. Let's break that down below.</p>
      <p><strong><u>No articles:</u></strong> Latin has no words specifically for <em>a/an</em> or <em>the</em>. When translating from Latin to English, you may need to supply the appropriate indefinite or definite article to make the sentence sound like English.</p>
      <p><strong><u>Inflection:</u></strong> Latin is an <em>inflected language</em>, which means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nouns change form based on their function in a sentence and their number (singular or plural).</li>
        <li>Adjectives change form to agree with the nouns they modify.</li>
        <li>Verbs change form based on their subject, tense, voice, and mood.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The main indicators for inflections of Latin nouns and adjectives are attached to their ends; for verbs, it is a combination of the endings and what immediately precedes those endings. (Most inflected languages that developed in Europe use endings; in other parts of the world, these indicators may appear at the beginning or in the middle of a word.)</p>
      <p><strong><u>Word order is not fixed:</u></strong> Like many other inflected languages, the order in which words appear in a sentence or clause is usually unimportant. It has some conventions that are not followed 100% faithfully, such as the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main verb of a clause appears at the end of that clause.</li>
        <li>Adjectives appear next to the nouns they modify (describe).</li>
        <li>Adverbs appear immediately before the verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs they modify.</li>
        <li>Some conjunctions appear in the second position within their clauses, not at the beginning.</li>
        <li>Prepositions appear immediately before their objects.</li></ul>
      <p>A word or phrase may appear at the beginning of a clause for emphasis.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Pulchra est illa toga!</strong> <em>That toga is <u>beautiful</u>!</em><br/>
        <p><strong>Caesar magnus imperātor erat.</strong> <em><u>Caesar</u> was a great general.</em></blockquote>
      <p>Beyond that, remember one fact of languages: most words have more than one possible translation. A Latin noun, verb, adjective, preposition, or conjunction may have multiple equivalents in English, and <em>vice versa</em>. When translating, our goal is to choose the best or most appropriate translation; there is seldom only one correct answer.</p>
      <h3>Inflection—Nouns</h3>
      <h4>Cases</h4>
      <p>Nouns in Latin can appear in any of six cases. The cases are such an important part of learning Latin that this text will always capitalize their names. The functions listed in the table below are merely examples; the Ablative has about 18 functions altogether.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Case</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Usages</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Nominative</strong></td>
          <td>Subject: <em>The <u>noun</u> is good.</em>Subject complement: <em>It is a good <u>noun</u>.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Vocative</strong></td>
          <td>Direct Address: <em>Hey <u>noun</u>, what’s happening?</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Genitive</strong></td>
          <td>Possessor: <em>What is the <u>noun’s</u> name?</em>Partitive: <em>May I have some <u>of your noun</u>?</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Dative</strong></td>
          <td>Indirect Object: <em>I created a new function <u>for the noun</u>.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Accusative</strong></td>
          <td>Direct Object: <em>I really like the <u>noun</u>.</em>Place to Which: <em>I am walking toward the<u> noun</u>.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Ablative</strong></td>
          <td>Place Where: <em>Are you in the<u> noun</u> right now?</em>Accompaniment: <em>I am traveling with the <u>noun</u>.</em>Means by Which: <em>I fixed the problem with a <u>noun</u>.</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <p>This is worth exploring through an example right here. Here is the word <strong>pāx</strong> (<em>peace</em>) appearing in a variety of cases.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Case</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Phrase</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Approximate Meaning</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Nominative</strong></td>
          <td><strong><u>Pāx</u></strong><strong> (sit) vōbīscum.</strong></td>
          <td><em>(May) peace (be) with you.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Genitive</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Āra <u>Pācis</u></strong></td>
          <td><em>The Altar of Peace, a sacred marble altar built in the time of Augustus and still visible in Rome.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Accusative</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Dōnā nōbīs <u>pācem</u>, ō Domine</strong></td>
          <td><em>Grant us peace, O Lord.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Ablative</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Requiescat in <u>pāce</u>.</strong></td>
          <td><em>May he/she rest in peace.</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <p>In the third example, <strong>Domine</strong> is a Vocative form of <strong>Dominus</strong>, and <strong>nōbīs</strong> is an indirect object in the Dative case.</p>
      <h4>Numbers</h4>
      <p>Nouns in Latin are either singular (one person, place, or thing) or plural (more than one). There are remnants of an older number, dual, but they are seldom used. A noun’s form in a sentence reflects a combination of its case and number.</p>
      <h4>Genders</h4>
      <p>Each noun in Latin is assigned to at least one of three genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Some nouns can be either masculine or feminine; to refer to those, this text posits a gender called <em>uter</em> (meaning <em>either of two</em>). This includes a few dozen words for occupations held mostly by men in ancient times that terminate in <strong>-a</strong> which is characteristic of the feminine gender—<em>e.g.</em>, <strong>poēta</strong> and <strong>pirāta</strong>. In our time of relative gender equity, we know that women can also be poets and pirates!</p>
      <h4>Declensions</h4>
      <p>Each noun in Latin belongs to one of five declensions, numbered I through V. A declension is a set of endings, corresponding to case and number, used to <em>decline</em> a noun or adjective.</p>
      <p>Nouns are not distributed evenly among the five declensions: III has nearly half of all nouns, V has the fewest by far, and IV has considerably fewer than I or II. However, the association between declensions and genders follows a symmetrical pattern:</p>
      <table><tbody>
      <tr><td><strong>I</strong></td>
        <td><strong>II</strong></td>
        <td><strong>III</strong></td>
        <td><strong>IV</strong></td>
        <td><strong>V</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td style="color: red">predominantly feminine</td>
        <td style="color: blue">masculine and neuter</td>
        <td style="color: purple">all three genders (or four if you count uter)</td>
        <td style="color: blue">masculine and (a few) neuter</td>
        <td style="color: red">predominantly feminine</td></tr>
      <tr><td style="color: blue">some masculine</td>
        <td style="color: red">some feminine (mostly types of trees)</td>
        <td> </td>
        <td style="color: red">some feminine (mostly types of trees)</td>
        <td style="color: blue">very few masculine</td></tr>
      </tbody></table>
      <p>The nouns that we have assigned to the uter gender are found mostly in Declensions I and III.</p>

      <h3>Inflection—Adjectives</h3>
      <h4>Agreement</h4>
      <p>Adjectives <em>modify</em> (describe) nouns. Each adjective must take a form that agrees with its noun in the dimensions of case, number, and gender—e.g., Accusative plural, feminine.</p>
      <h4>Understood Nouns</h4>
      <p>Sometimes adjectives appear without a noun. The gender signified by the adjective’s ending allows you to assume <em>people</em>or <em>things</em> as the noun.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When these adjectives show masculine or feminine endings, <em>a person</em> or <em>people</em> is understood (i.e., assumed): <strong>multī</strong>= <em>many people</em>.</li>
        <li>When these adjectives show neuter endings, <em>a thing</em> or <em>things</em> is understood: <strong>multa</strong> = <em>many things</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Degrees</h4>
      <p>Most adjectives can appear in any of three degrees: positive, comparative, or superlative.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the comparative degree when comparing any two persons, places, or things; it can also translate as <em>quite, rather,</em> or <em>too</em>. Comparative forms always use endings from Declension III.</li>
        <li>Use the superlative degree if there are three or more persons, places, or things; it can also translate as <em>very</em> or variations thereof. Superlative forms always use endings from Declensions I and II.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some adjectives lack the comparative and superlative forms, and thus depend on an adverb (like <em>more</em> and <em>most</em> in English) along with the positive forms.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Degree</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Usages</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Positive</strong></td>
          <td><em>She is an <u>adjective</u> poet.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Comparative</strong></td>
          <td><em>She is an <u>adjectiver</u>/a <u>more adjective</u> poet than you.</em><em>As a free-verse poet she is <u>quite adjective</u>.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Superlative</strong></td>
          <td><em>She is the adjectivest/most adjective poet I have ever known.</em><em>As a free-verse poet she is <u>very adjective</u>.</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <h4>Declensions</h4>
      <p>Each adjective belongs either to Declensions I and II, Declension III, or no declension at all. The declension of an adjective and its noun do not always match:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Declension I and II</strong>—These adjectives use Declension I endings when modifying feminine nouns, II for masculine nouns, and II with neuter variations for neuter nouns. This is true irrespective of the declension of the nouns that they modify.</li>
        <li><strong>Declension III</strong>—These adjectives use mostly the same set of endings for modifying any noun of any gender, with some variations for neuter.</li>
        <li><strong>Indeclinable</strong>—The form remains unchanged irrespective of case or gender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most of the cardinal numbers have no declension, and thus have the same form in all six cases. However, the numbers for <em>one, two</em>, and <em>three</em> have their own peculiar declensions. When demonstrative and relative pronouns are used as adjectives (see below), they also exhibit special declensional behaviors.</p>
      <h3>Inflection—Pronouns</h3>
      <h4>Types</h4>
      <p>Pronouns are divided into different types or categories: personal, reflexive, demonstrative, relative, interrogative, and indefinite. Demonstrative pronouns sometimes act as adjectives; relative pronouns sometimes act as interrogative adjectives.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Type</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Usages</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Personal</strong></td>
          <td><em><u>I</u></em><em> adore <u>him</u>.</em> <em><u>She</u></em><em> will give <u>it</u> to <u>you</u>.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Reflexive</strong></td>
          <td><em>He adores <u>himself</u>.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Demonstrative</strong></td>
          <td><em><u>This</u></em><em> woman adores <u>that</u> man.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Relative</strong></td>
          <td><em>This is the man <u>whom</u> I adore.</em> <em>This is the gift <u>that</u> I gave him.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Interrogative</strong></td>
          <td><em><u>Whom</u></em><em> do you adore?</em> <em><u>What</u></em><em> would you like to buy him?</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Indefinite</strong></td>
          <td><em>Has <u>anybody</u> told you that you look like <u>somebody</u> I adore?</em> <em><u>Everybody</u></em><em> doesn’t like <u>something</u>.</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <h4>Declensions</h4>
      <p>The declensions of pronouns are either slightly different from that of nouns or vastly different. Each type of pronoun has commonalities as to how it is declined; most of the divergences are found in the singular forms of the Genitive and Dative cases. This <em>pronominal </em>declension shows up in about a dozen adjectives as well: For the most part, those adjectives fall into Declensions I and II, but not in the Genitive and Dative singular.</p>
      <h3>Inflection—Verbs</h3>
      <h4>Persons and Numbers</h4>
      <p>Verb forms in Latin can show which person is the subject: 1<sup>st</sup> (I or we), 2<sup>nd</sup> (you or y’all), or 3<sup>rd</sup> (literally anyone or anything else). All verb forms are either singular (one person, place, or thing is the subject) or plural (a group of persons, places, or things is the subject). In any clause, a verb must have the ending that <em>agrees</em> with its subject in person and number.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Person</em></strong></td><td><strong><em>Singular</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Plural</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>1<sup>st</sup></strong></td>
          <td><strong>ego</strong>/<em>I</em></td>
          <td><strong>nōs</strong>/<em>we</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>2<sup>nd</sup></strong></td>
          <td><strong>tū</strong>/<em>you (s.), thou</em></td>
          <td><strong>vōs</strong>/<em>you (pl.), y’all, ye</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>3<sup>rd</sup></strong></td>
          <td><strong>is, ea, id</strong>/<em>he, she, it</em>any other singular subject</td><td><strong>eī, eae, ea</strong>/<em>they</em>any other plural subject</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> The pronouns <strong>is/eī, ea/eae,</strong> and <strong>id/ea</strong> are the Nominative singular and plural forms of the third-person pronoun in the masculine, feminine, and neuter genders, respectively.</p>
      <p>If the subject is first- or second-person, or if the third-person subject is understood, the pronoun is not required: <strong>Cōgitō, ergo sum</strong> means <em>I think, therefore I am</em>, no <strong>ego</strong> required.</p>
      <h4>Tenses</h4>
      <p>Nearly all verbs in Latin can appear in any of six tenses. The tenses are divided into two tense systems, each of which is built on a different stem. The middle portion of a verb form reflects its tense; there are a few <em>defective </em>verbs that lack one of the systems.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Tense System</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Tense</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Usages</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td rowspan="3"><strong>Present</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Present</strong></td>
          <td><em>I <u>verb</u>, I do <u>verb</u>, I am <u>verb</u>ing</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Imperfect</strong></td>
          <td><em>I was <u>verb</u>ing, I used to <u>verb</u></em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Future</strong></td>
          <td><em>I shall <u>verb</u></em></td></tr>
        <tr><td rowspan="3"><strong>Perfect</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Perfect</strong></td>
          <td><em>I <u>verb</u>ed, I have <u>verb</u>ed</em></td></tr
        ><tr><td><strong>Pluperfect</strong></td>
          <td><em>I had <u>verb</u>ed</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Future Perfect</strong></td>
          <td><em>I shall have <u>verb</u>ed</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <h4>Voices</h4>
      <p>Most Latin verbs can appear in either the active or passive voice. The ending of a verb reflects a combination of person, number, and voice—e.g., 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural, active.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the active voice when the subject is performing an action.</li>
        <li>Use the passive voice when the subject is being acted upon.</li>
      </ul>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Voice</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Usages</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Active</strong></td>
          <td><em>I verb, I was verbing, etc.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Passive</strong></td>
          <td><em>I am verbed, I was being verbed, etc.</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <p>Verbs that do not show direct action on someone or something generally do not appear in the passive voice. There is also a large set of <em>deponent</em> verbs that have passive endings but translate in the active voice.</p>
      <h4>Moods</h4>
      <p>Latin verbs can appear in any of three moods: indicative, subjunctive, or imperative. The middle portion of a verb form, the ending, or some combination of the middle and ending reveals the mood.</p>
      <table><thead>
      <tr><td><strong><em>Mood</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>Sample Usages</em></strong></td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Indicative</strong></td>
          <td>Statements or questions of fact: <em>I verb, I was verbing</em>, etc.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Subjunctive</strong></td>
          <td>Statements of possibility or conditionality: <em>May they verb, so that they might verb, if they had verbed</em>, etc.<br/>
            Indirect questions: <em>We asked him which noun had verbed him.</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Imperative</strong></td>
          <td>Direct commands: <em>Verb! Verb, y’all!</em></td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
      <p>The imperative mood is generally confined to the 2<sup>nd</sup> person, singular and plural, in the present tense. On rare occasions, you will see 3<sup>rd</sup>-person and future-tense forms, but generally you can get by with just two forms (compare that to the 72 forms in the indicative mood).</p>
      <h4>Conjugations</h4>
      <p>Every <em>regular</em> and <em>deponent</em> verb in Latin belongs to one of four conjugations. You can tell the conjugation of a verb via its present <em>imperative</em> form (<em>to <u>verb</u></em>).</p>
      <p>There is also a small set of <em>irregular </em>and <em>defective </em>verbs that have their own peculiar conjugations that you must memorize. It just so happens, as in several other inflected languages, that some of the most commonly used verbs in Latin are irregular—e.g., <em>to be, to want</em>.</p>
      <h4>Principal Parts</h4>
      <p>Entries for verbs in a Latin dictionary begin with the principal parts. Most regular and irregular verbs have four principal parts; some have just three. Deponent verbs have no more than three. There is a small group of defective verbs (that’s the grammarians’ term, not mine) that lack some parts.</p>
      <p>What are these principal parts?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First:</strong> the first-person singular present active indicative (<em>I <u>verb</u></em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Second:</strong> the present infinitive (<em>to <u>verb</u></em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Third:</strong> the first-person singular perfect active indicative (<em>I <u>verb</u>ed</em> or <em>I have <u>verb</u>ed</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth:</strong> the supine form, which can be either
          <ul>
            <li>a perfect passive participle (<em>having been <u>verb</u>ed</em>) or</li>
            <li>a future active participle (<em>about to <u>verb</u></em>)</li></ul></li></ul>
      <p>Verbs with no passive voice forms may lack the fourth part entirely or have a future active participle in that position.</p>
      <p>The principal parts of any verb are a guide to its conjugation in all three moods (indicative, subjunctive, imperative). The first two parts indicate how to conjugate it in the present system of tenses; the third, the perfect system in the active voice; the fourth, the perfect system in the passive voice.</p>
      <h4>Infinitives, Participles, Gerunds, and Gerundives</h4>
      <p>Verbs can also be turned into adjectives or nouns by adding a few letters to their stems. A verb used as an adjective is a participle; a verb used as a noun may be a gerund or a gerundive. These adjectives and nouns have declensions just like the regular kind.</p>
      <p>The infinitive forms of a verb can also serve as nouns, including as subjects of sentences, as in <em><u>To err</u> is human</em>.</p>

          <td>Don’t let verbing dogs lie.There is still a lot of unverbed food here.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Gerund</strong></td>
          <td>I came here for the sake of verbing.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Gerundive</strong></td>
          <td>I went there for the purpose of verbing some nouns.</td></tr>

      <h3>Other Parts of Speech</h3>
      <p>Unlike nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs, these other parts of speech are not inflected in Latin (with very few exceptions, because all rules in Latin seem to have exceptions).</p>
      <h4>Adverbs</h4>
      <p>Use adverbs to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Some adverbs are derived from adjectives, with a special adverbial ending, but quite a few are not. Latin adjectives have suffixes like the English&nbsp;<em>-ly</em> to turn adjectives into adverbs. The only inflection that happens to adverbs is that they can take comparative and superlative forms.</p>
      <h4>Prepositions</h4>
      <p>Prepositions never change their forms. However, the nouns or adjectives that serve as their <em>objects</em> will generally take on endings for the Accusative or Ablative case. Some prepositions take Accusative objects, some take Ablative, and some can take either case depending on the meaning they convey.</p>
      <h4>Conjunctions</h4>
      <p>Use conjunctions to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses. They range from the familiar <em>and, but,</em> and <em>or</em> to more complex ones like <em>nevertheless</em> and <em>on the other hand</em>.</p>
      <p>Several of the complex conjunctions conventionally appear in the second position within a clause, or at least never at the very beginning of a clause. Grammarians call these <em>postpositive</em> conjunctions.</p>
      <h4>Interjections</h4>
      <p><em>Hurray</em>, Latin has some of these too! Mostly they avoid inflection, but some of them are Ablative forms of nouns (<strong>Hercle!</strong> = <em>by Hercules!</em>) or Accusatives of exclamation (<strong>Ō malum!</strong> = <em>Oh, wickedness!</em>).</p>
      <h4>Particles</h4>
      <p>Latin has some word-parts that can be attached to the ends of words but can never stand on their own. Grammarians call these <em>word particles</em> or just <em>particles</em>. They may serve as adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, or some other purpose that is difficult to classify.</p>
