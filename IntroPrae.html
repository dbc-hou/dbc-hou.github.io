      <h2>Latin for the End of the World</h2>
      <p>The global climate is going bonkers, and we have very little time to act toward preventing destruction
      on an almost-unimaginable scale.</p>
      <p>Civilization is collapsing, along with the unraveling of vital institutions and social norms.</p>
      <p>And in the back of your mind, a voice is saying, <em>Y'know, I've always wanted to learn Latin.
      There isn't much time left, so I'd better get started.</em></p>
      <p>This site began as an attempt to write a Latin textbook for language geeks, home-schoolers, and others
      to teach themselves the Latin language—or at least a good portion thereof. It is also designed to be
      somewhat entertaining—or, at least, not as dry as most Latin texts.</p>
      <p>We haven't created a fictitious Roman family, like the one found in the <em>Ecce Romani</em> series,
      to populate these pages. We didn't hire an illustrator to draw typical Romans, or even shell out a few bucks
      for stock images to decorate the lessons. (We might provide links to pictures here and there.)
      We don't have Latin dialogs or narrative paragraphs to introduce or conclude each lesson. Instead,
      we're relying on snarky commentary and semi-useful trivia to keep things lively.</p>
      <p>Each lesson starts with some vocabulary, mostly words that have something in common. In some lessons
      you may also find related words or phrases to give the vocabulary an extra dimension—<em>e.g.</em>,
      when you learn the noun <strong>equus</strong> (<em>horse</em>), you may also learn the related
      adjective <strong>equīnus</strong> (<em>horselike, horse-related</em>), whence comes the English derivative
      <em>equine</em>.</p>
      <p>We are also assiduous in helping you distinguish among words that appear similar but whose meanings are
      unrelated. For example, the English words <em>equal</em> and <em>equity</em> have nothing to do with
      <strong>equus</strong>; they come from the adjective <strong>aequus</strong>, meaning <em>fair, just, equal</em>.
      (During the Medieval Era, the <strong>ae</strong> diphthong in <strong>aequus</strong> devolved
      into a simple <strong>e</strong>.)</p>
