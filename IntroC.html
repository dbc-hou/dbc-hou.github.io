      <h2>C. Pronunciation: Basics</h2>
      <p>This collection of lessons uses the Classical pronunciation of Latin—or, more accurately, what linguists theorize Latin sounded like in the Late Republic and Early Empire periods. The actual pronunciation of Latin as spoken in ancient Rome is not known with complete certainty. Centuries of linguistic detective work has produced a general theory of the pronunciations of individual letters and combinations of letters (e.g., diphthongs). Fortunately for students of Latin, pronunciation of each letter in the alphabet is remarkably consistent in ancient Latin.</p>
      <p>The Classical Roman alphabet consisted of 20 letters: <strong>ABCDEFGHILMNOPQRSTVX</strong>. Ancient Romans, having not yet invented lowercase letters, wrote (or carved) in all capital letters. However, we will include lowercase letters in this text because they make reading easier.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The letters <strong>I</strong> and <strong>V</strong> did double duty as both consonants and vowels. As the language evolved, consonantal <strong>I</strong> became <strong>J</strong>, and vocalic <strong>V</strong> became <strong>U</strong>.</li>
        <li>The letter <strong>K</strong> was archaic, a remnant of Etruscan, and quite rare.</li>
        <li>The letters <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> were used for words borrowed from Greek upsilon and zeta, respectively, to transcribe foreign words.</li>
        <li>The letter <strong>W</strong> did not come along until much later; even today, most European languages ignore it, change it to a <strong>V</strong>, or use it grudgingly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will begin our exploration of pronunciation with vowels and combinations thereof.</p>

      <p><strong><u>IMPORTANT NOTE:</u></strong> Classical Latin is one of those languages that, at least officially, has no silent letters. Pronounce everything. In Ecclesiastical Latin, centuries ago, it was decided that Latin should be pronounced much like Italian, and that <strong>h</strong> should not be pronounced at all. Furthermore, Latin has no schwa sounds: Every vowel always gets its full value.</p>
      <p><strong><u>The Long &amp; Short of Vowels:</u></strong> Latin has the same vowels familiar to English speakers, but in short and long forms. In ancient Latin, the long vowels take longer to pronounce than the short ones and even sound a bit different, as in modern languages such as Czech, Hungarian, and Japanese. Medieval Latin does not distinguish between short and long vowels, pronouncing them similarly to modern Italian.</p>
      <p><em>Actual written Latin does not contain macrons to show the length of a vowel</em>. This is just a feature of modern Latin textbooks to get students accustomed to pronouncing the long vowels longer than (and slightly different from) the short vowels. So how do we know about long and short vowels? The rules for the structure of verse in Greek and Latin poetry is based on the length of syllables. Every syllable contains at least one vowel; a syllable is long when it meets one of these criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>it contains a long vowel</li><li>it contains a diphthong (two vowels that together make a single sound)</li>
        <li>it contains a short vowel followed by two or more consonants</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A long or short vowel can make a difference in the meaning of a word or the function of a noun in a sentence. The most dramatic example of this distinction is the following pair of words:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>occidō</strong> = <em>I fall/I die</em></li>
        <li><strong>occīdō</strong> = <em>I cut down/I kill</em></li></ul>
      <p>The length of a vowel may affect which syllable in a word is accented. In the example above, <strong>occīdō</strong> is pronounced <em>ok-KEE-doh</em>, while <strong>occidō</strong> is pronounced <em>OK-ki-doh</em>. (See the Accentuation section below.)</p>
      <p><strong><u>Diphthongs:</u></strong> The table above includes the three main <em>diphthongs</em> native to Latin: <strong>ae, au,</strong> and <strong>oe</strong>. There are four additional, less common diphthongs: <strong>ai</strong>, <strong>ei</strong>, <strong>eu</strong>, and <strong>ui</strong>. As with the letter <strong>y</strong>, the diphthongs are mostly used for transcriptions from other languages. These diphthongs are pronounced as the first vowel gliding into the second: e.g., <strong>ai</strong> = <strong>a</strong> + <strong>i</strong>. Whether a diphthong is native to Latin or adopted from another language, it is considered long.</p>
      <h4>i As a Consonant</h4>

      <tr><td>Combination</td>
        <td>Ancient</td>
        <td>As In…</td></tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody><tr><td><strong>ia</strong> or <strong>iā</strong></td>
          <td><strong>ya</strong>rn</td>
          <td><strong>iaculum</strong> (<em>javelin</em>)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>ie</strong> or <strong>iē</strong></td>
          <td><strong>ye</strong>ll or <strong>Ya</strong>le</td>
          <td><strong>iecur</strong> (<em>liver</em>)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>io</strong> or <strong>iō</strong></td>
          <td><strong>yo</strong>ke</td>
          <td><strong>iōcum</strong> (<em>joke</em>)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>iu</strong> or <strong>iū</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Yu</strong>le</td>
          <td><strong>iūgum</strong> (<em>yoke</em>)</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>At the end of a word, the <strong>i</strong> and the vowel that follows it usually occupy separate syllables: <strong>vic-tō-ri-a, se-ri-ēs,</strong> etc.</p>
        <h4>Accentuation</h4>
        <p>Latin words longer than one syllable have their accents <em>only</em> in the second to last (penultimate) or third to last (antepenultimate) syllables. If the word has two syllables, accent the penultimate (i.e., first) syllable. For words of three or more syllables, if the penult is long (per the rules cited previously), it gets the accent; if short, the antepenult is accented.</p>
        <p>The word <strong>puella</strong> in the table above has three syllables. Since the <strong>e</strong> precedes two consonants, its syllable is considered long, and thus it is accented.</p>
        <p>One noteworthy quirk is that word fragments such as <strong>-ne</strong> and <strong>-que</strong> at the end of a word lengthen the preceding syllable, thus making that (penultimate) syllable accented.</p>
        <h3>Consonants</h3>
        <p>As stated earlier, consonants in ancient Latin are remarkably consistent and predictable; ecclesiastical Latin has a few notable exceptions, following rules from modern Italian. Wherever a consonant’s pronunciation differs appreciably from the English equivalent, it is noted in the table below.</p>
        <p>For the most part, <strong>k</strong> and <strong>z</strong> are used for foreign words or proper names. The letter <strong>k</strong> was part of the Roman alphabet in its early stages, but gradually evolved out of use, replaced by <strong>c</strong>.</p>
        <p>The letter <strong>q</strong>, without exception, is accompanied by a <strong>u</strong> (written as a <strong>v</strong> in ancient Latin). Latin <strong>qu</strong> is pronounced like <em>kw</em>, as in modern Italian, but unlike in French or Spanish.</p>
        <p>Lastly, a bit of trivia: <strong>x</strong> is the only consonant that never appears at the beginning of a Latin word. Greek is the language that gives us <em>xenophobia</em> and<em> xylophone</em>.</p>

          <tr><td><strong>x</strong></td><td>always like a <em>ks</em>, as in ta<strong>x</strong>; never like a <em>gz</em>, as in e<strong>x</strong>act</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>z </strong>(rare)<strong></strong></td>
            <td>possibly like a <em>dz</em>, as in a<strong>dz</strong>e</td></tr>
          </tbody></table>
          <p><strong><u>Digraphs:</u></strong> Sometimes the letter <strong>h</strong> will appear as part of a digraph, usually for words and names borrowed from Greek. The digraphs <strong>ch</strong>, <strong>ph</strong>, and <strong>th</strong> are just aspirated versions of <strong>c</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, and <strong>t</strong>—<em>i.e.,</em> with a little extra breath behind them. Don’t be tempted to <strong>ch</strong>uck your <strong>ph</strong>one into the <strong>th</strong>istles!</p>
          <p><strong><u>Doubles:</u></strong> Lastly, let’s address what happens with double consonants, as in the words <strong>bellum</strong> (<em>war</em>), <strong>gemma</strong> (<em>gem</em>), and <strong>vacca</strong> (<em>cow</em>). As one would in Italian, lean into these doubles and take a little longer to pronounce them. As with any other pair of consecutive consonants, they make the syllable long.</p>
          <h3>Ecclesiastical Pronunciation</h3>
          <p>As mentioned previously, the “Church Latin” that developed in the Medieval era did not have vowels with different quantities. All the vowels and diphthongs sound similar to how we pronounce the long vowels of Classical Latin. Pronounce <strong>y</strong> (always an internal vowel) like Classical <strong>ī</strong>; the diphthongs <strong>ae</strong> and <strong>oe</strong>, like the Classical <strong>ē</strong>.</p>
          <p>Consonants also get the Italian treatment:</p>
