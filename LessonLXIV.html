      <h2>LXIV. Modus Operandī</h2>

      <p>This lesson introduces some deponent verbs of Conjugation II. It also features two more ways to make
        verbs fill the roles of nouns and adjectives: the <em>gerund</em> and the <em>gerundive</em>.</p>
      <p>There aren’t a full dozen deponent verbs in Conjugation II suitable for introduction at this point
        in your learning. So we have a few more verbs from Conjugation I to toss at you.</p>

      <h3>Vocabulary Notes</h3>

      <p><strong><u>fateor:</u></strong> Its combining forms are <strong>-fiteor</strong> and <strong>-fessus</strong>, as in <strong>confiteor</strong> and <strong>profiteor</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong><u>fūror, minor:</u></strong> The former looks like the Latin noun <strong>furor</strong>,
        with the only difference in spelling being the length of the <strong>u</strong>. The latter is spelled
        exactly like the comparative adjective <strong>minor</strong> (<em>smaller, less</em>); thus, <strong>minus
          minor</strong> can mean <em>I threaten less.</em></p>
      <p><strong><u>liceor, polliceor:</u></strong> The former looks like <strong>licet-licēre</strong>, but
        its meaning is only distantly related. We cheated a bit on the latter: <strong>pol-</strong> is a
        combining form of the prefix <strong>por-</strong>, whose meaning is similar to <strong>prō-</strong>
        (<em>forth, further</em>). You may also see some similarity between <strong>polliceor</strong> and
        <strong>pollex-pollicis</strong>. You can think of giving a “thumbs-up” when you make a promise,
        but there is no hard evidence of their being related.</p>
      <p><strong><u>reor:</u></strong> A noun derived from this verb is <strong>ratiō</strong>, which can mean
        a plan of action or a calculation. <em>Rational</em> numbers can be calculated to their exact values.</p>
      <p><strong><u>videor:</u></strong> This is indeed the passive of <strong>videō-vidēre</strong>, recast
        as a deponent verb. It has the active meaning <em>seem</em> or <em>appear</em>most frequently when seen
        with an accompanying infinitive (often <strong>esse</strong>).</p>

      <h3>Gerunds: Verbal Nouns</h3>
      <p>Sometimes infinitives serve as the subject of a clause: <strong>Errāre est humānum</strong>.
        Notice how the adjective complementing <strong>errāre</strong> is neuter? You can think of the
        infinitive as a neuter noun.</p>
      <p>Sometimes infinitives serve as the direct object of a verb: <strong>Errāre amō</strong>. What do you like?
        I like to wander (or to make mistakes). However, we have yet to see infinitives as objects of prepositions
        either in Latin or in English.</p>
      <p>Latin has a solution for that: the gerund. It has only singular forms and Declension II neuter endings.
        Gerunds have a characteristic <strong>-nd-</strong> termination between the present stem and those endings,
        which translates into English as <em>-ing</em>—not the <em>-ing</em> we’re accustomed to seeing in participles (verbal adjectives), but as a noun.</p>
      <p>Deponent verbs form their gerunds in the same way: present stem + <strong>nd</strong> +
        <strong>ī/ō/um</strong>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Genitive: <strong>errandī/vagandī</strong> = <em>of wandering</em></li>
        <li>Accusative: <strong>ad errandum/ad vagandum</strong> = <em>for the purpose of wandering</em></li>
        <li>Ablative: <strong>errandō/vagandō</strong> = <em>by wandering</em> (Ablative of means)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The gerund shows up in the Dative case as well, but not often.</p>
      <p>You may see the Genitive form with <strong>causā</strong> or <strong>grātiā</strong>, both of which
        translate as <em>for the sake of</em>.</p>
      <p><em>To wander</em> is an intransitive verb. If you want to do the same thing with transitive verbs,
        or verbs that take objects of any kind, you need something more flexible.</p>

      <h3>Gerundives: The Gerund Expansion Pack</h3>
      <p>The gerundive in Latin takes the gerund a step further, serving as both a verbal noun and a verbal
        adjective. It has two main uses: obligation and purpose. It uses the same <strong>-nd-</strong>
        attachment to the present stem, followed by all the endings for a Declension I &amp; II adjective.</p>
      <h4>Gerundive of obligation</h4>
      <p>When you see a list of things to be accomplished at a meeting or on a journey, that list is called
        an <strong>agenda</strong>, the Latin for <em>things to be done</em>. A singular item on that list
        would be <strong>agendum</strong>. One of several prominent Romans named M. Porcius Cātō lived and
        served in the Senātus Rōmānus during the Third Punic War. He developed a habit of ending every speech
        with the sentence <strong>Carthāgō dēlenda est!</strong>—<em>Carthage must be destroyed</em>.</p>
      <p>In Cato’s exhortations, <strong>dēlenda</strong> is an adjective modifying the feminine noun
        <strong>Carthāgō</strong> and meaning <em>having to be destroyed</em>. The feminine name
        <strong>Amanda</strong> means <em>she who must be loved</em>; <strong>Miranda</strong>, <em>she who
          must be marveled at.</em> A clergyperson is called <em>Reverend</em>, which comes from
        <strong>reverendus</strong>, <em>a person who must be respected</em> (or <em>feared</em>).</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Haec verba testis crēdendī sunt.</strong><br> = <em>These are the words of a witness who must be believed.</em></blockquote>
      <p>As happens with participles, gerundives can take the place of a relative clause.</p>
      <p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> <em>This is the only usage for deponent verbs that translates in the passive voice!</em></p>
      <p>Sometimes a gerundive of obligation appears in an Ablative absolute: <em>the <u>noun</u> (or <u>substantive adjective</u>) having to be <u>verbed</u></em>, or <em>it being necessary to <u>verb</u> the <u>noun</u></em>. As with any Ablative absolute, you can apply an appropriate temporal, causal, or circumstantial conjunction (<em>when, since, although, etc</em>.)</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Arbitrō adulandō, testātī sumus dē calliditāte eius.</strong><br/> = <em>Because the judge had to be flattered, we bore witness as to his cleverness.</em><br/>
        <strong>Mūtātīs mūtandīs, negōtium perfēcimus.</strong><em><br/> = All things being changed that needed changing, we completed the task.</em></blockquote>
      <p>The latter example above uses <strong>mūtō, -āre, -āvī, -ātum</strong>, meaning <em>change</em>.</p>

      <h4>Dative of personal agent with gerundives</h4>
      <p>If you wish to express <em>by whom</em> something <em>must be done</em>, the doer does not appear
        in the Ablative case as you might expect, but in the Dative, with no preposition. This is because
        obligation is considered more of a <em>to/for</em> situation than a by situation. Fortunately,
        if the doer is plural or in Declension II, it looks very much like an Ablative form.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Carthāgō <u>nōbīs</u> delenda est!</strong>=<em>Carthage must be destroyed
        <u>by us</u>!</em><br/>
        <strong><u>Mihi</u> confitendum est mē eum miserērī nōn posse.</strong><br/> = <em>I must confess (it must be confessed <u>by me</u>) that I cannot pity him.</em></blockquote>
      <p>In some contexts, such as the second example above, a noun or pronoun that serves as a subject in English appears as a Dative of personal agent in Latin. If the gerundive is formed from a verb that takes Dative objects, then the noun that one would think would be Nominative is instead Dative.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Eī crēdendus est.</strong> = <em>He/She must be believed (one ought to believe him/her).</em></blockquote>
      <h4>Gerundive of purpose</h4>
      <p>If one does something for a reason, Latin has several ways to express that reason:</p>

      <ol type="1"><li>a dependent clause with the verb in the subjunctive mood, which we have yet to learn</li>
        <li><strong>causā</strong> or <strong>grātiā</strong> with a gerund in the Genitive case if the action takes no object</li>
        <li><strong>ad</strong> with a Gerundive in the Accusative case plus a direct object.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> In Classical Latin, the infinitive is <em>never</em> used to express purpose.
        However, in Medieval or Ecclesiastical Latin, the infinitive sometimes fills that role.</p>
      <p>So <strong>causā fūrandī</strong>, with a gerund, means <em>for the sake of stealing</em>, and it
        doesn’t matter what one steals; <strong>ad saxum fūrandum</strong> means <em>for the sake/purpose of
          stealing a/the rock</em>. (A less common alternative is <strong>causā saxī fūrandī</strong>.)</p>
      <p>Notice in the examples below that the gerundive agrees with its direct object in case, number, and
        gender:</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Hūc vēnistī ad rēgīnam minandam?</strong> = <em>Did you come here to threaten the queen?</em><br/>
        <strong>Minimē, sed ad fīliōs eius tuendōs vēnī!<em> = </em></strong><em>No, but I came to protect
          her sons!</em></blockquote>
      <p>There are other uses for gerundives, such as situations involving Ablatives of means, but we will
        save those for another lesson.</p>

        <h3>Exercise LXIV: Your Agenda</h3>
        <p>Translate these phrases into Latin, using either gerunds or gerundives where appropriate.</p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li>by making an offer</li>
          <li>of promising</li>
          <li>in order to encourage the thief</li>
          <li>she must be flattered</li>
          <li>y’all must confess</li>
          <li>by trading</li>
          <li>for the purpose of wandering</li>
          <li>for the purpose of protecting the witnesses</li>
          <li>the merchants must try</li>
          <li>prayers are to be respected</li>
          <li>in order to delay my wrath</li>
          <li>because jokes had to be earned (<em>hint: use an Ablative absolute!</em>)</li>
        </ol>
